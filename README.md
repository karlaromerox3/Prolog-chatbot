# Prolog Chatbot for communicating processes in an organization
It is known that communication is hard to achieve in big companies, especially when teams are spread all across the world. Issues like not speaking the same language, time zones and general misunderstandings arise when a process is trying to be communicated. 
Sometimes a single email could be enough when you want to share how to do something to a new team, but many times they go unnoticed  and the users have to check it many times before they memorize it.

Another alternative often used by organizations is creating a FAQ page somewhere in the web, however that can lead to security issues and revealing information to teams that shouldn't be seeing it. 
My proposal is to use chatbots.
